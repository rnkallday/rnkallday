                This is where you tell your story. Who are you? What drives you? 
                How did you end up doing what you do? Keep it conversational and 
                authentic—people connect with humans, not resumes.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Talk about your background as a writer, your journey into music, 
                how you got into video production. What connects all these things? 
                (Hint: it's probably storytelling in different mediums.)
            </p>

                Add a paragraph about what you're looking for—collaborations, 
                freelance work, full-time opportunities, or just interesting 
                conversations with interesting people.
