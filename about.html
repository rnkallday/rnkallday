            <p>
                I tell stories...some with words, some with music, all with intent. I'm a creative force that advocates for AI literacy as a means to maintain authenticity in a world that's drowning in tasteless, prefabricated slop. I stand at the crossroads of tradition and progress, watching the world evolve and dragging the skeptics along for the ride. My work spans a wide range - from art and culture to AI - and you’ll find it published in places that care about such things.

                I’ve washed dishes with ex-convicts, raised millions for the arts, and learned that the only real job security is curiosity.

                I’m that guy with the untamed mohawk and worn-in 501s on your morning train. I’ll also be that guy you swear you know from somewhere, standing in a finely tailored tux at the opera tonight. And when you blink during your double take, you might just see yourself reflected in my work.
